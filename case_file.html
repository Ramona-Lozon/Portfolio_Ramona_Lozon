<div id="project">Earbuds</div>

<div id="proposition"><p>this is a project i did while enrolled at fanshawe in my interactive media design program, where we set out to design a pair of earbuds with a case</p></div>

<div id="deliverables"><p>for this project, we needed to take our designs, 3-d model them, and build a website with an interactive interface where users could see</p></div>

<div id="media_1"><img src="assets/earbuds_sketches-01.jpg" width="300px"></div>

<div id="media_1_notes"><p>we started in the conceptual stage, designing the look of the earbuds and the case. here are some concepts that i took into Cinema 4d</p></div>

<div id="media_2"><img src="assets/Earbuds-Retro-poster1.jpg" width="300px"></div>

<div id="media_2_notes"><p>after modeling the earbuds in C4d, we made promotional images, set up hot spots and prepared to create an x-ray view of the internal components</p></div>

<div id="media_3"><video src="assets/Earbuds-Retro-test1.mp4" width="300px"></div>

<div id="media_3_notes"><p>the final product is a website that was built using SASS, Javascript, and Greensock, for functionality</p></div>

<div id="outcome">by the end of the project we had a working website that acted as an advertising page for the earbuds, displaying their features using a 3d model viewer and showing their internal workings using a slider created with SASS and Greensock.</div>
